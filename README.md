Overview:

This is a monocular odometry Python project that uses OpenCV to read video frames, detect features, 
and perform monocular odometry. This project aims to demonstrate the application of 
computer vision techniques for motion estimation in videos.




I plan on making this run in real-time in the future and eventually write a stereo camera
version that gives numerical scale to the motion. 


Example:
(Video blurred for privacy)
